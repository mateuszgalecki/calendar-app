//STARTING THE REACT RENDER

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();


//EXPORTING ALL THE ACTIONS FOR FURTHER USE

export function actionsFunction() {
